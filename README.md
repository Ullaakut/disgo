Simple library for building Go command-line interfaces.

Disgo provides four essential features for most user-friendly CLI applications:

1. Simple output levels
2. Output formatting
3. Step-by-step outputs
4. Simple user prompting

## Terminal

The disgo `Terminal` provides an easy way to build user-friendly command-line interfaces.

You can use it globally within your application, or you can instantiate your own `Terminal`.

### Terminal options

When creating a `Terminal` instance or when using the global `Terminal` that this package provides, you might want to give it some options, such as:

- **`WithDebug`**, which lets you enable or disable the debug output _(it is disabled by default)_
- **`WithDefaultWriter`**, which lets you specify an `io.Writer` on which `Debug` and `Info`-level outputs should be written _(it is set to `os.Stdout` by default)_
- **`WithErrorWriter`**, which lets you specify an `io.Writer` on which `Error`-level outputs should be written _(it is set to `os.Stderr` by default)_
- **`WithReader`**, which lets you specify an `io.Reader` from which the Terminal will be able to prompt the user _(it is set to `os.Stdin` by default)_
- **`WithColors`**, which lets you explicitely enable or disable colors in your output _(it is enabled by default)_
- **`WithInteractive`**, which specifies whether the Terminal should run in an interactive way, meaning prompts should wait for user input. If set to false, prompts will instantaneously returns their configured default value _(it is set to `true` by default)_

You can either pass those options to `disgo.NewTerminal()` when creating a `Terminal` instance, like so:

```go
    term := disgo.NewTerminal(disgo.WithDebug(true))
```

Or, if you are using the global terminal, you will simply need to call the `SetTerminalOptions` function:

```go
    disgo.SetTerminalOptions(disgo.WithDebug(true))
```

### Writing to the Terminal

Now that your terminal is set up, you can start writing to it.

Here is how to use them on an instantiated terminal:

```go
    // All of those give the same output:
    // "Number of days in a year: 365" followed by a newline.
    term.Infoln("Number of days in a year:", 365)
    term.Infof("Number of days in a year: %d\n", 365)
    term.Info("Number of days in a year: 365\n")

    // Debug methods are similar to info, except that they are not printed
    // if debug outputs are not enabled on the terminal.
    term.Debugln("Number of days in a year:", 365)
    term.Debugf("Number of days in a year: %d\n", 365)
    term.Debug("Number of days in a year: 365\n")

    // Error methods are similar to info, except that they are written on
    // the error writer (os.Stderr by default).
    term.Errorln("Number of days in a year:", 365)
    term.Errorf("Number of days in a year: %d\n", 365)
    term.Error("Number of days in a year: 365\n")
```

When using the global terminal, call the terminal printing functions directly:

```go
    // All of those give the same output:
    // "Number of days in a year: 365" followed by a newline.
    disgo.Infoln("Number of days in a year:", 365)
    disgo.Infof("Number of days in a year: %d\n", 365)
    disgo.Info("Number of days in a year: 365\n")

    // Debug methods are similar to info, except that they are not printed
    // if debug outputs are not enabled on the terminal.
    disgo.Debugln("Number of days in a year:", 365)
    disgo.Debugf("Number of days in a year: %d\n", 365)
    disgo.Debug("Number of days in a year: 365\n")


    // Error methods are similar to info, except that they are written on
    // the error writer (os.Stderr by default).
    disgo.Errorln("Number of days in a year:", 365)
    disgo.Errorf("Number of days in a year: %d\n", 365)
    disgo.Error("Number of days in a year: 365\n")
```

### Step-by-step processes

A lot of command-line interfaces describe **step-by-step processes** to the user, but it's difficult to combine clean code, clear output and elegant user interfaces. Disgo attempts to solve that problem by associating _steps_ to its terminal.

For example, when beginning a task, you can use `StartStep` and specify the description of that step. Then, until that task is over, all calls to Disgo's printing functions will be queued. Once the task is complete (by calling `EndStep`, `FailStep` or by starting another step with `StartStep`), the task status is printed and all of the outputs that were queued during the task are printed with an indent, under the task, like so:

<p align="center">
    <img width="70%" src="images/example_step_by_step.png" />
</p>

It is also important to note that **`FailStep` and `FailStepf` can be used to return errors** at the same time as they report a step as having failed. This allows you to write:

```go
    disgo.StartStep("Doing something")
    if err := doSomething(); err != nil {
        return disgo.FailStepf("unable to do something: %v", err)
    }
```

Instead of having to call `FailStep` in your error handling before returning. You are still free to do so if you prefer, though.

Using the global terminal for step management is not thread-safe though, as it was built with simplicity in mind and can only handle one step at a time.

### Confirmation prompt

The confirmation prompt lets you **prompt users** for a yes or no answer.

```go
    result, err := disgo.Confirm(disgo.Confirmation{
        Label:              "Install with current database?",
    })
```

Will produce the following output:

```bash
Install with current database? [y/n]
```

To which the user can answer by `y`, `n`, `Y`, `N`, `yes`, `no`, `YES,` `NO`, `0`, `1`, `true`, `false`, etc.

The confirmation prompt supports default values, like so:

```go
    result, err := disgo.Confirm(disgo.Confirmation{
        EnableDefaultValue: true,
        DefaultValue:       false,
        Label:              "Install with current database?",
    })
```

This will set the default value to false, so that when the user does not have access to a TTY or that he simply presses enter to skip the prompt, a value of your choosing is used.

It's also possible to add **your own confirmation parsers**, if you don't want the user to answer to a yes/no question for example. This also means that you can customize the choices that will be presented to the user:

```go
    result, err := disgo.Confirm(disgo.Confirmation{
        Label:              "Install with current database?",
        Choices:            []string{"yes", "no"},
        Parser:             func(input string) (bool, error) {
            switch input {
            case "yes":
                return true, nil
            case "no":
                return false, nil
            default:
                return false, fmt.Errorf("invalid input %q", input)
            }
        },
    })
```

This will output:

```bash
Install with current database? [yes/no]
```

And will use a custom parser for parsing the user's answer.

### String input prompt

Not implemented yet.

## Style

The `style` package provides simple output formatting functions as well as some cherry-picked UTF-8 symbols that can be useful for building rich command-line interfaces.

### Output Formatting

The `style` package exposes six different output formats, which print its argument with a specific color, font-weight and font-style depending on what the output's content should convey to the user. For example, if you want to attract a user's attention to an error, you might use the `style.Failure()` formatting function, like so:

```go
    if err := validateConfiguration; err != nil {
        disgo.Errorln("Invalid configuration detected:", style.Failure(err))
        return err
    }
```

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/output_failure.png" />
</p>

Other output formats include `Success`, `Trace`, `Important` and `Link`.

<p align="center">
    <img width="40%" src="images/output_all.png" />
</p>

You can of course combine those formats in elegant ways, like shown in the [examples](#examples) section.

### Symbols

Disgo provides **aliases to UTF-8 characters** that could be useful to build your command-line interfaces.

```go
    disgo.Infoln(style.SymbolCheck) // ✔
    disgo.Infoln(style.SymbolCross) // ✖
    disgo.Infoln(style.SymbolLeftArrow) // ❮
    disgo.Infoln(style.SymbolRightArrow) // ❯
    disgo.Infoln(style.SymbolLeftTriangle) // ◀
    disgo.Infoln(style.SymbolRightTriangle) // ▶
```

## Examples

Here are a few examples of Disgo's output, using this repository's example program:
